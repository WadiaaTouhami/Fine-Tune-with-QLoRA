I\\u2019d never been and had seen a lot of films about Brazil and Rio. Despite all of the things you hear about the favelas and the dangerous side of things, it had such a good vibe. Everyone there seems to be health and fitness crazy. At every bus stop or by the beach, almost at every point you could see, there was an outside gym or a frame to work out on. So there were people all over the place getting jacked up or doing chin ups and it was really cool. I\\u2019ve never seen anything like it. It was a perfectly balanced trip for us, which was really good. We\\u2019re just going into that competition phase and normally we train at home but to go out there really helped mix it up. It keeps you fresh and it\\u2019s good to be with the team as we enjoy spending time with each other. Chris Mears marks his departure for Rio de Janeiro for a Team GB diving training camp with a selfie . Mears says going to Rio was was a perfectly balanced trip for the team usually spread around the UK . Without National Lottery funding, we wouldn\\u2019t be able to go out and do trips like this. Of course we get the chance to enjoy ourselves and get refreshed, but it\\u2019s also such a great opportunity to do some really good work before all the exciting things ahead. We got a lot of serious training done and when Alexei Evangulov, our performance director, decided to go to Rio, it was partly because they have one of the best gym facilities in the world. To have that was a really big part of going there. But we were also based just over the road from the beach so it only took us about 10 seconds to get there \\u2013 Alexei definitely got that one right! It was great to do the tourist thing but in a way it gets that excitement out of the way for the next time we go. Hopefully then we will all be in serious competition mode. Health-wise it also helps us boost our vitamin D with all the sunshine. That gets low in the winter so there\\u2019s no better way to top that up than spend some time in Rio! Unfortunately we couldn\\u2019t eat street food because, with strict drug testing, we have to know what goes in our bodies, but the food at the hotel was incredible. There was so much rich, vibrant fruit, which was great, but going out to eat was tough. None of us speak Portuguese and there wasn\\u2019t much English spoken, so when Jack Laugher and I were free, we tried to book a table but the people at the restaurant had no idea what we were on about! It was great to enjoy moments like that and I think we are the closest knit team in Team GB. A lot of training programmes train together 24/7 but we\\u2019re scattered all over the country. There\\u2019s a bunch of us in Leeds, Plymouth and London so when we come together it\\u2019s such a good laugh. Going to see Christ the Redeemer was phenomenal. It\\u2019s hard to explain how good it was. It wasn\\u2019t just the statue, it was that stunning view for miles around. Luckily you can get a coach up to the top \\u2013 we didn\\u2019t have to run up there for extra training! It was great to go to the beach too and the waves were huge, so that was a lot of fun. With team-mate Jack Laugher, Mears says their lack of Portuguese made it tricky to dine out in Rio . The diving team's performance director Alexei Evangulov 'got it right' booking a hotel by the beach . Mears was blown away by Rio's famous Christ the Redeemer statue and 'the stunning view for miles around' The Team GB divers get along brilliantly, says Mears, so enjoyed each other's company in Rio . It\\u2019s also a very exciting time for me right now because my first single is finally coming out. I\\u2019ve got a music deal with Universal and I\\u2019ve been working so hard to reach this stage and now for it to be released is crazy. I\\u2019m moving in with Jack in March and will hopefully get to set up a bit of a studio to work in between training. As divers we have quite a big fan base in Mexico for some reason so I recently went there to do a bit of a tour and do some DJ sets. So the first single is actually called \\u2018Mexico\\u2019 and is dropping there first! So it\\u2019s been a busy few weeks but all exciting stuff. The trip to Rio was a small but significant step towards reaching our Olympic dreams and it really whet our appetite. To stand there on the boards and see the Olympic rings already up in the stadium, we were all thinking: \\u2018Yep, this is going to be good.\\u2019 As well as funding the Road to Rio athletes, every week National Lottery players raise over \\u00a333 million for arts, heritage, charity, community projects and grass roots sports clubs and facilities.

It emerged today that 25 Birmingham schools are now being investigated for links to the alleged radicalisation plot, and while Birmingham City Council has refused to name the schools, some of which have upwards of 600 students, it means that vast numbers of pupils could have been at risk. The number of schools allegedly involved rose today from 15 to 25 as Education Secretary Michael Gove is said to have told Ofsted inspectors to fail any school 'where religious conservatism is getting in the way of learning and a balanced curriculum'. This afternoon Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg backed the investigations, saying schools should not be allowed to become 'silos of segregation'. Scroll down for video . It emerged today that 25 schools in Birmingham, including Park View Academy, pictured, are being investigated by Ofsted over allegations that Muslim extremists were trying to force out moderate headteachers . As the scale of the alleged plot became apparent, Birmingham City Council appointed a new chief adviser, former head teacher Ian Kershaw, to handle at least 200 complaints received in relation to the 'Trojan Horse' alleged plot to take over primary, secondary, and community schools as well as academies in the city. The unsigned and undated Trojan Horse letter claimed that a small but radical group of Muslims was pursuing its own agenda in the classrooms, with uncooperative headteachers and governors forced out. It said that the plot had caused 'a great amount of organised disruption' in the city, crediting it with forcing a change of leadership at four schools. At the centre of the scandal is Birmingham\\u2019s Park View Academy, where it is alleged that \\u00a370,000 was spent on loudspeakers to call pupils to Islamic prayers. Birmingham City Council's investigation will run beside a separate inquiry by the Department for Education (DfE), and will report back on 15 schools initially next month, with a fuller report due in July. Headteachers and governors judged to be performing 'inadequately' in terms of pushing religious views to the detriment of children's education may be immediately dismissed. Since the appearance of the letter in March, anonymous whistle-blowers including former staff have come forward, making claims that boys and girls were segregated in classrooms and assemblies, and sex education was banned. It was also alleged that non-Muslim staff had been bullied, and in one case it was alleged that the teachings of a firebrand Al Qaeda-linked Muslim preacher praised to pupils. Investigation: Education Secretary Michael Gove, left, and Birmingham City Council leader Sir Albert Bore, right . Birmingham City Council today announced the six-month appointment of Mr Kershaw, managing director of Northern Education, to handle the investigation, and the council said it was also setting up a review group made up of MPs, councillors, police and faith groups. The council's leader, Sir Albert Bore, said the investigation was slowed by the two-tier school system, which meant that academies, which are at the centre of the allegations, were answerable not to the local authority but to the DfE, calling the situation 'frustrating in the extreme'. And Sir Albert suggested that the alleged Muslim extremist plot may extend beyond Birmingham, saying that his authority had spoken to councils in both Manchester and Bradford. He said: 'There are certainly issues in Bradford which have similarities with the issues being spoken about in Birmingham.' Fresh claims . have emerged in Manchester and at Bradford's . Laisterdyke Business and Enterprise College and Carlton Bolling . College. An Ofsted spokesman said it had not begun inspections there, but did not rule it out. Sir Albert also said that West Midlands Police, which has reopened a fraud inquiry into one of the schools caught up in the allegations, was still looking into the authorship of the Trojan Horse document, the authenticity of which is still unclear. Lindsey Clark, the headteacher of Park View, said she would act against anyone plotting against the school . One of the schools being investigated over extremist infiltration cancelled its annual visit from Father Christmas last year.Teacher Vicky Hubble, who organised the event at the secular Ladypool Primary School, was allegedly told to cancel it by the new Muslim headmaster, Huda Aslam.He is said to have told her there would be no presents and \\u2018no mention\\u2019 of Jesus being the son of God.According to a fellow teacher, Mr Aslam wanted to reduce festivities to little more than sing-alongs to songs such as Jingle Bells, but was forced to reinstate the Christmas assembly by Birmingham Council. However, Santa remained banned. But a DfE official said yesterday: \\u2018Extreme religious conservatism often acts as an . entry to later problems. \\u2018A . child who is brought up age eight, nine, ten, believing that you should . segregate the sexes and hand out Islamic textbooks is more likely to be . radicalised in later life.\\u2019 David Cameron has promised \\u2018swift action\\u2019 to ensure schools are not used to spread terrorist ideology. Birmingham city council froze appointments of any new school governors last week. But MPs said change should have come sooner. Liam Byrne, Labour MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill, which covers several of the schools, said the probe was moving at \\u2018glacial\\u2019 speed. Birmingham . MP Khalid Mahmood said that the council has known of the claims for . \\u2018eight years at least\\u2019 but had failed to act for fear of \\u2018appearing . anti-Muslim\\u2019.\",\n          \"By . Emily Allen . PUBLISHED: . 05:09 EST, 30 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:28 EST, 30 August 2012 . Hospital staff called a woman to say her father needed urgent tests - while she was with family and friends at his wake. Oksana Holbrook couldn\\u2019t believe her ears when a nurse from Nottingham City Hospital rang her mobile phone to ask her 89-year-old father to come in for blood tests, just after she had buried him. Ms Holbrook, 55, of Carlton, Nottingham, said the nurse wanted her father, Mychajlo Tiahnybida, to have his blood checked to see if his prostate cancer had got any worse. Horrified: Oksana Holbrook took a call from a nurse at Nottingham City . Hospital at her father's wake asking the 89-year-old (pictured in the photo) to come in for . blood tests . But he had just been buried at Wilford Hill Cemetery, Nottingham, and the family was at his wake in the city\\u2019s Ukranian Cultural Centre. Ms Holbrook, said: 'I couldn\\u2019t believe it. It proved what a waste of space the hospitals were - one department was not talking to the other.' Nottingham University Hospitals Trust admitted it had made a mistake. Jenny Leggott, director of nursing and midwifery, said: 'We extend our sympathy to the family for their sad loss and offer sincere apologies. Passed away: The nurse wanted Ms Holbrook's father, Mychajlo Tiahnybida, pictured, to have his . blood checked to see if his prostate cancer had got worse . 'Due an administrative error the information about this patient\\u2019s death was not processed as it should have been. 'An alert which would have avoided any further contact from the hospital was omitted from the medical record.' Mr Tiahnybida was told he had prostate cancer at Nottingham City Hospital in April. After . falling at home in West Bridgford, Nottingham, he was admitted to the . city\\u2019s Queen\\u2019s Medical Centre in May for eight weeks, before being . discharged and readmitted on the same day at the end of July. Error: Mr Tiahnybida was told he had prostate cancer at Nottingham City Hospital (pictured) in April. The hospital apologised and said the error was an administrative one when his death was processed incorrectly . Mr Tiahnybida, a former carpenter for Boots, was sent to Lings Bar Hospital, Gamston, Nottingham, a week later and died on Wednesday, August 8. His funeral was held on August 20. NHS Notts Healthcare, which runs Lings Bar, said: 'In the event of a patient\\u2019s death, Lings Bar Hospital follows a strict procedure, issuing an electronic death discharge letter to the patient\\u2019s GP and to medical secretaries across other organisations. 'On this occasion this letter was sent out to all necessary parties on August 10, two days after Mr Tiahnybida\\u2019s death.' Ms Holbrook said she also had concerns over her father\\u2019s discharge at the end of July, and would make a complaint.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"highlights\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4998,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Binky loves Cheryl's gorgeous glossy look .\\nShe says that her fellow brunette is her beauty inspiration .\\nShe shows you how to achieve her dramatic eyes and glowing skin .\",\n          \"Kyrstin Lavelle boldly asked President Obama to sign her journal after she spotted him on Tuesday .\\nThe president was enjoying his morning workout at Marine Corps Base Hawaii in Kaneohe Bay while on his vacation .\\nHe wrote 'To Kyrstin - Dream big dreams!'\\nKyrstin described him as 'really nice' and gave him some flowers .\",\n          \"David Reid, 50, posed as an investor for friends and vulnerable people .\\n'Clever and affable' conman threw \\u00a310,000 parties for customers at his home .\\nHe spent \\u00a33.5million of their money on fast cars, luxury hotels, and a boat .\\nIn total 50 people were conned, losing their homes, life savings and pensions .\\nA little boy with Down's syndrome missed out on a once-in-a-lifetime Disney Land holiday when his parents were duped .\\nReid was sentenced to six years in jail after admitting to the fraud .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

and rio despite all of the things you hear about the favelas and the dangerous side of things it had such a good vibe everyone there seems to be health and fitness crazy at every bus stop or by the beach almost at every point you could see there was an outside gym or a frame to work out on so there were people all over the place getting jacked up or doing chin ups and it was really cool i ve never seen anything like it it was a perfectly balanced trip for us which was really good we re just going into that competition phase and normally we train at home but to go out there really helped mix it up it keeps you fresh and it s good to be with the team as we enjoy spending time with each other chris mears marks his departure for rio de janeiro for a team gb diving training camp with a selfie mears says going to rio was was a perfectly balanced trip for the team usually spread around the uk without national lottery funding we wouldn t be able to go out and do trips like this of course we get the chance to enjoy ourselves and get refreshed but it s also such a great opportunity to do some really good work before all the exciting things ahead we got a lot of serious training done and when alexei evangulov our performance director decided to go to rio it was partly because they have one of the best gym facilities in the world to have that was a really big part of going there but we were also based just over the road from the beach so it only took us about 10 seconds to get there alexei definitely got that one right it was great to do the tourist thing but in a way it gets that excitement out of the way for the next time we go hopefully then we will all be in serious competition mode health wise it also helps us boost our vitamin d with all the sunshine that gets low in the winter so there s no better way to top that up than spend some time in rio unfortunately we couldn t eat street food because with strict drug testing we have to know what goes in our bodies but the food at the hotel was incredible there was so much rich vibrant fruit which was great but going out to eat was tough none of us speak portuguese and there wasn t much english spoken so when jack laugher and i were free we tried to book a table but the people at the restaurant had no idea what we were on about it was great to enjoy moments like that and i think we are the closest knit team in team gb a lot of training programmes train together 24 7 but we re scattered all over the country there s a bunch of us in leeds plymouth and london so when we come together it s such a good laugh going to see christ the redeemer was phenomenal it s hard to explain how good it was it wasn t just the statue it was that stunning view for miles around luckily you can get a coach up to the top we didn t have to run up there for extra training it was great to go to the beach too and the waves were huge so that was a lot of fun with team mate jack laugher mears says their lack of portuguese made it tricky to dine out in rio the diving team s performance director alexei evangulov got it right booking a hotel by the beach mears was blown away by rio s famous christ the redeemer statue and the stunning view for miles around the team gb divers get along brilliantly says mears so enjoyed each other s company in rio it s also a very exciting time for me right now because my first single is finally coming out i ve got a music deal with universal and i ve been working so hard to reach this stage and now for it to be released is crazy i m moving in with jack in march and will hopefully get to set up a bit of a studio to work in between training as divers we have quite a big fan base in mexico for some reason so i recently went there to do a bit of a tour and do some dj sets so the first single is actually called mexico and is dropping there first so it s been a busy few weeks but all exciting stuff the trip to rio was a small but significant step towards reaching our olympic dreams and it really whet our appetite to stand there on the boards and see the olympic rings already up in the stadium we were all thinking yep this is going to be good as well as funding the road to rio athletes every week national lottery players raise over 33 million for arts heritage charity community projects and grass roots sports clubs and facilities find out where your money

replace them with extremists it emerged today that 25 birmingham schools are now being investigated for links to the alleged radicalisation plot and while birmingham city council has refused to name the schools some of which have upwards of 600 students it means that vast numbers of pupils could have been at risk the number of schools allegedly involved rose today from 15 to 25 as education secretary michael gove is said to have told ofsted inspectors to fail any school where religious conservatism is getting in the way of learning and a balanced curriculum this afternoon deputy prime minister nick clegg backed the investigations saying schools should not be allowed to become silos of segregation scroll down for video it emerged today that 25 schools in birmingham including park view academy pictured are being investigated by ofsted over allegations that muslim extremists were trying to force out moderate headteachers as the scale of the alleged plot became apparent birmingham city council appointed a new chief adviser former head teacher ian kershaw to handle at least 200 complaints received in relation to the trojan horse alleged plot to take over primary secondary and community schools as well as academies in the city the unsigned and undated trojan horse letter claimed that a small but radical group of muslims was pursuing its own agenda in the classrooms with uncooperative headteachers and governors forced out it said that the plot had caused a great amount of organised disruption in the city crediting it with forcing a change of leadership at four schools at the centre of the scandal is birmingham s park view academy where it is alleged that 70 000 was spent on loudspeakers to call pupils to islamic prayers birmingham city council s investigation will run beside a separate inquiry by the department for education dfe and will report back on 15 schools initially next month with a fuller report due in july headteachers and governors judged to be performing inadequately in terms of pushing religious views to the detriment of children s education may be immediately dismissed since the appearance of the letter in march anonymous whistle blowers including former staff have come forward making claims that boys and girls were segregated in classrooms and assemblies and sex education was banned it was also alleged that non muslim staff had been bullied and in one case it was alleged that the teachings of a firebrand al qaeda linked muslim preacher praised to pupils investigation education secretary michael gove left and birmingham city council leader sir albert bore right birmingham city council today announced the six month appointment of mr kershaw managing director of northern education to handle the investigation and the council said it was also setting up a review group made up of mps councillors police and faith groups the council s leader sir albert bore said the investigation was slowed by the two tier school system which meant that academies which are at the centre of the allegations were answerable not to the local authority but to the dfe calling the situation frustrating in the extreme and sir albert suggested that the alleged muslim extremist plot may extend beyond birmingham saying that his authority had spoken to councils in both manchester and bradford he said there are certainly issues in bradford which have similarities with the issues being spoken about in birmingham fresh claims have emerged in manchester and at bradford s laisterdyke business and enterprise college and carlton bolling college an ofsted spokesman said it had not begun inspections there but did not rule it out sir albert also said that west midlands police which has reopened a fraud inquiry into one of the schools caught up in the allegations was still looking into the authorship of the trojan horse document the authenticity of which is still unclear lindsey clark the headteacher of park view said she would act against anyone plotting against the school one of the schools being investigated over extremist infiltration cancelled its annual visit from father christmas last year teacher vicky hubble who organised the event at the secular ladypool primary school was allegedly told to cancel it by the new muslim headmaster huda aslam he is said to have told her there would be no presents and no mention of jesus being the son of god according to a fellow teacher mr aslam wanted to reduce festivities to little more than sing alongs to songs such as jingle bells but was forced to reinstate the christmas assembly by birmingham council however santa remained banned but a dfe official said yesterday extreme religious conservatism often acts as an entry to later problems a child who is brought up age eight nine ten believing that you should segregate the sexes and hand out islamic textbooks is more likely to be radicalised in later life david cameron has promised swift action to ensure schools are not used to spread terrorist ideology birmingham city council froze appointments of any new school governors last week but mps said change should have come sooner liam byrne labour mp for birmingham hodge hill which covers several of the schools said the probe was moving at glacial speed birmingham mp khalid mahmood said that the council has known of the claims for eight years at least but had failed to act for fear of appearing anti muslim \",\n          \"by emily allen published 05 09 est 30 august 2012 updated 05 28 est 30 august 2012 hospital staff called a woman to say her

kenneth trump president of national school safety and security services an ohio based firm specializing in school security the no 1 way we find out about weapons in schools is not from a piece of equipment such as a metal detector but from a kid who comes forward and reports it to an adult that he or she trusts see how many homicides have occurred in schools since 1992 the obama administration plans to create secure schools indirectly by improving overall education getting kids more involved in their studies and strengthening school communities said william modzeleski a high ranking official in the u s department of education who handles school security the trend is reflected in security funding some of which comes from federal grants allocations for the department of education s safe and drug free schools program were cut by a third between 1999 and 2008 to about 294 8 million last year and a program that has put about 6 300 police officers in public schools since columbine was scrapped by the u s department of justice after 2005 according to corey ray a spokesman for the department ray said he s hopeful president obama s stimulus package will put more police officers in schools they act as law enforcement officers as well as counselors and mentors to students he said meanwhile money for a school counseling grant program has increased since columbine with 52 million set aside for this fiscal year compared to 20 million in 2000 the first year the program was funded according to budget numbers compiled for cnn by the department of education so while there s more money available for counseling there s still been a steady decline in federal spending for other aspects of school security some critics say a lack of available funding for high tech security upgrades may be behind the shift toward less costly and more indirect violence prevention measures right now the economic situation is affecting school security funding particularly the technology components of security are going to suffer because there s just not going to be the money to do these kinds of things said dan domenech executive director of the american association of school administrators we re in the process of laying off teachers and staff trump the security consultant in ohio said schools have lost their focus on security since columbine but he added that many effective security programs cost little or no money only the time it takes to train teachers and students how to spot potential problems and how to react if a shooting were to occur while metal detectors may not be the best tools to prevent school shootings they still can be useful in some crime ridden school districts and along with security cameras should not be abandoned entirely modzeleski said some evidence suggests strong school communities where kids feel like they can come forward with problems can prevent violent crime a 2008 secret service report found that in more than 80 percent of instances of school violence at least one person usually a fellow student or peer had knowledge of the attackers plans if people who suspect a problem feel comfortable enough in school to tell a teacher or a principal then attacks could be prevented modzeleski said after columbine many states and school districts made quick moves to increase school security experts say modzeleski said this was a kneejerk reaction to the tragic but rare event and a decade later policies are settling into a middle ground immediately after any of these incidents i think there s the immediate rush for more security he said that s what i would call the kneejerk reaction to any type of these events we need more cops we need more metal detectors we need more cameras after that settles in i think people come to their senses and say hey if we re going to keep our kids safe in schools we need more than that ireport com how did columbine affect you after columbine some states started requiring schools to prepare for

states are attended by armed and masked swat teams are now practiced routinely in nearly three quarters of schools according to a recent survey of 445 administrators funded by the american association of school administrators it s difficult to say whether these policies are working but by some measures school safety has improved in the decade since columbine watch parents remember children lost at columbine on average there have been about half as many deaths per year since columbine as in the seven school years before the tragedy according to a 2007 report from the national center for

and rio despite all of the things you hear about the favelas and the dangerous side of things it had such a good vibe everyone there seems to be health and fitness crazy at every bus stop or by the beach almost at every point you could see there was an outside gym or a frame to work out on so there were people all over the place getting jacked up or doing chin ups and it was really cool i ve never seen anything like it it was a perfectly balanced trip for us which was really good we re just going into that competition phase and normally we train at home but to go out there really helped mix it up it keeps you fresh and it s good to be with the team as we enjoy spending time with each other chris mears marks his departure for rio de janeiro for a team gb diving training camp with a selfie mears says going to rio was was a perfectly balanced trip for the team usually spread around the uk without national lottery funding we wouldn t be able to go out and do trips like this of course we get the chance to enjoy ourselves and get refreshed but it s also such a great opportunity to do some really good work before all the exciting things ahead we got a lot of serious training done and when alexei evangulov our performance director decided to go to rio it was partly because they have one of the best gym facilities in the world to have that was a really big part of going there but we were also based just over the road from the beach so it only took us about 10 seconds to get there alexei definitely got that one right it was great to do the tourist thing but in a way it gets that excitement out of the way for the next time we go hopefully then we will all be in serious competition mode health wise it also helps us boost our vitamin d with all the sunshine that gets low in the winter so there s no better way to top that up than spend some time in rio unfortunately we couldn t eat street food because with strict drug testing we have to know what goes in our bodies but the food at the hotel was incredible there was so much rich vibrant fruit which was great but going out to eat was tough none of us speak portuguese and there wasn t much english spoken so when jack laugher and i were free we tried to book a table but the people at the restaurant had no idea what we were on about it was great to enjoy moments like that and i think we are the closest knit team in team gb a lot of training programmes train together 24 7 but we re scattered all over the country there s a bunch of us in leeds plymouth and london so when we come together it s such a good laugh going to see christ the redeemer was phenomenal it s hard to explain how good it was it wasn t just the statue it was that stunning view for miles around luckily you can get a coach up to the top we didn t have to run up there for extra training it was great to go to the beach too and the waves were huge so that was a lot of fun with team mate jack laugher mears says their lack of portuguese made it tricky to dine out in rio the diving team s performance director alexei evangulov got it right booking a hotel by the beach mears was blown away by rio s famous christ the redeemer statue and the stunning view for miles around the team gb divers get along brilliantly says mears so enjoyed each other s company in rio it s also a very exciting time for me right now because my first single is finally coming out i ve got a music deal with universal and i ve been working so hard to reach this stage and now for it to be released is crazy i m moving in with jack in march and will hopefully get to set up a bit of a studio to work in between training as divers we have quite a big fan base in mexico for some reason so i recently went there to do a bit of a tour and do some dj sets so the first single is actually called mexico and is dropping there first so it s been a busy few weeks but all exciting stuff the trip to rio was a small but significant step towards reaching our olympic dreams and it really whet our appetite to stand there on the boards and see the olympic rings already up in the stadium we were all thinking yep this is going to be good as well as funding the road to rio athletes every week national lottery players raise over 33 million for arts heritage charity community projects and grass roots sports clubs and facilities find out where your money

replace them with extremists it emerged today that 25 birmingham schools are now being investigated for links to the alleged radicalisation plot and while birmingham city council has refused to name the schools some of which have upwards of 600 students it means that vast numbers of pupils could have been at risk the number of schools allegedly involved rose today from 15 to 25 as education secretary michael gove is said to have told ofsted inspectors to fail any school where religious conservatism is getting in the way of learning and a balanced curriculum this afternoon deputy prime minister nick clegg backed the investigations saying schools should not be allowed to become silos of segregation scroll down for video it emerged today that 25 schools in birmingham including park view academy pictured are being investigated by ofsted over allegations that muslim extremists were trying to force out moderate headteachers as the scale of the alleged plot became apparent birmingham city council appointed a new chief adviser former head teacher ian kershaw to handle at least 200 complaints received in relation to the trojan horse alleged plot to take over primary secondary and community schools as well as academies in the city the unsigned and undated trojan horse letter claimed that a small but radical group of muslims was pursuing its own agenda in the classrooms with uncooperative headteachers and governors forced out it said that the plot had caused a great amount of organised disruption in the city crediting it with forcing a change of leadership at four schools at the centre of the scandal is birmingham s park view academy where it is alleged that 70 000 was spent on loudspeakers to call pupils to islamic prayers birmingham city council s investigation will run beside a separate inquiry by the department for education dfe and will report back on 15 schools initially next month with a fuller report due in july headteachers and governors judged to be performing inadequately in terms of pushing religious views to the detriment of children s education may be immediately dismissed since the appearance of the letter in march anonymous whistle blowers including former staff have come forward making claims that boys and girls were segregated in classrooms and assemblies and sex education was banned it was also alleged that non muslim staff had been bullied and in one case it was alleged that the teachings of a firebrand al qaeda linked muslim preacher praised to pupils investigation education secretary michael gove left and birmingham city council leader sir albert bore right birmingham city council today announced the six month appointment of mr kershaw managing director of northern education to handle the investigation and the council said it was also setting up a review group made up of mps councillors police and faith groups the council s leader sir albert bore said the investigation was slowed by the two tier school system which meant that academies which are at the centre of the allegations were answerable not to the local authority but to the dfe calling the situation frustrating in the extreme and sir albert suggested that the alleged muslim extremist plot may extend beyond birmingham saying that his authority had spoken to councils in both manchester and bradford he said there are certainly issues in bradford which have similarities with the issues being spoken about in birmingham fresh claims have emerged in manchester and at bradford s laisterdyke business and enterprise college and carlton bolling college an ofsted spokesman said it had not begun inspections there but did not rule it out sir albert also said that west midlands police which has reopened a fraud inquiry into one of the schools caught up in the allegations was still looking into the authorship of the trojan horse document the authenticity of which is still unclear lindsey clark the headteacher of park view said she would act against anyone plotting against the school one of the schools being investigated over extremist infiltration cancelled its annual visit from father christmas last year teacher vicky hubble who organised the event at the secular ladypool primary school was allegedly told to cancel it by the new muslim headmaster huda aslam he is said to have told her there would be no presents and no mention of jesus being the son of god according to a fellow teacher mr aslam wanted to reduce festivities to little more than sing alongs to songs such as jingle bells but was forced to reinstate the christmas assembly by birmingham council however santa remained banned but a dfe official said yesterday extreme religious conservatism often acts as an entry to later problems a child who is brought up age eight nine ten believing that you should segregate the sexes and hand out islamic textbooks is more likely to be radicalised in later life david cameron has promised swift action to ensure schools are not used to spread terrorist ideology birmingham city council froze appointments of any new school governors last week but mps said change should have come sooner liam byrne labour mp for birmingham hodge hill which covers several of the schools said the probe was moving at glacial speed birmingham mp khalid mahmood said that the council has known of the claims for eight years at least but had failed to act for fear of appearing anti muslim \",\n          \"by emily allen published 05 09 est 30 august 2012 updated 05 28 est 30 august 2012 hospital staff called a woman to say her

article.\\n\\ni ve just got back from a training camp in rio and it was such an amazing trip i d never been and had seen a lot of films about brazil and rio despite all of the things you hear about the favelas and the dangerous side of things it had such a good vibe everyone there seems to be health and fitness crazy at every bus stop or by the beach almost at every point you could see there was an outside gym or a frame to work out on so there were people all over the place getting jacked up or doing chin ups and it was really cool i ve never seen anything like it it was a perfectly balanced trip for us which was really good we re just going into that competition phase and normally we train at home but to go out there really helped mix it up it keeps you fresh and it s good to be with the team as we enjoy spending time with each other chris mears marks his departure for rio de janeiro for a team gb diving training camp with a selfie mears says going to rio was was a perfectly balanced trip for the team usually spread around the uk without national lottery funding we wouldn t be able to go out and do trips like this of course we get the chance to enjoy ourselves and get refreshed but it s also such a great opportunity to do some really good work before all the exciting things ahead we got a lot of serious training done and when alexei evangulov our performance director decided to go to rio it was partly because they have one of the best gym facilities in the world to have that was a really big part of going there but we were also based just over the road from the beach so it only took us about 10 seconds to get there alexei definitely got that one right it was great to do the tourist thing but in a way it gets that excitement out of the way for the next time we go hopefully then we will all be in serious competition mode health wise it also helps us boost our vitamin d with all the sunshine that gets low in the winter so there s no better way to top that up than spend some time in rio unfortunately we couldn t eat street food because with strict drug testing we have to know what goes in our bodies but the food at the hotel was incredible there was so much rich vibrant fruit which was great but going out to eat was tough none of us speak portuguese and there wasn t much english spoken so when jack laugher and i were free we tried to book a table but the people at the restaurant had no idea what we were on about it was great to enjoy moments like that and i think we are the closest knit team in team gb a lot of training programmes train together 24 7 but we re scattered all over the country there s a bunch of us in leeds plymouth and london so when we come together it s such a good laugh going to see christ the redeemer was phenomenal it s hard to explain how good it was it wasn t just the statue it was that stunning view for miles around luckily you can get a coach up to the top we didn t have to run up there for extra training it was great to go to the beach too and the waves were huge so that was a lot of fun with team mate jack laugher mears says their lack of portuguese made it tricky to dine out in rio the diving team s performance director alexei evangulov got it right booking a hotel by the beach mears was blown away by rio s famous christ the redeemer statue and the stunning view for miles around the team gb divers get along brilliantly says mears so enjoyed each other s company in rio it s also a very exciting time for me right now because my first single is finally coming out i ve got a music deal with universal and i ve been working so hard to reach this stage and now for it to be released is crazy i m moving in with jack in march and will hopefully get to set up a bit of a studio to work in between training as divers we have quite a big fan base in mexico for some reason so i recently went there to do a bit of a tour and do some dj sets so the first single is actually called mexico and is dropping there first so it s been a busy few weeks but all exciting stuff the trip to rio was a small but significant step towards reaching our olympic dreams and it really whet our appetite to stand there on the boards and see the olympic rings already up in the stadium we were all thinking yep this is going to be good as well as funding the road to rio athletes every week national lottery players raise over 33 million for arts heritage charity community projects and grass roots sports clubs and facilities find out where your money goes at lotterygoodcauses org uk \\\\Summary:\\nthe

muslim plot to force out moderate school governors and heads and replace them with extremists it emerged today that 25 birmingham schools are now being investigated for links to the alleged radicalisation plot and while birmingham city council has refused to name the schools some of which have upwards of 600 students it means that vast numbers of pupils could have been at risk the number of schools allegedly involved rose today from 15 to 25 as education secretary michael gove is said to have told ofsted inspectors to fail any school where religious conservatism is getting in the way of learning and a balanced curriculum this afternoon deputy prime minister nick clegg backed the investigations saying schools should not be allowed to become silos of segregation scroll down for video it emerged today that 25 schools in birmingham including park view academy pictured are being investigated by ofsted over allegations that muslim extremists were trying to force out moderate headteachers as the scale of the alleged plot became apparent birmingham city council appointed a new chief adviser former head teacher ian kershaw to handle at least 200 complaints received in relation to the trojan horse alleged plot to take over primary secondary and community schools as well as academies in the city the unsigned and undated trojan horse letter claimed that a small but radical group of muslims was pursuing its own agenda in the classrooms with uncooperative headteachers and governors forced out it said that the plot had caused a great amount of organised disruption in the city crediting it with forcing a change of leadership at four schools at the centre of the scandal is birmingham s park view academy where it is alleged that 70 000 was spent on loudspeakers to call pupils to islamic prayers birmingham city council s investigation will run beside a separate inquiry by the department for education dfe and will report back on 15 schools initially next month with a fuller report due in july headteachers and governors judged to be performing inadequately in terms of pushing religious views to the detriment of children s education may be immediately dismissed since the appearance of the letter in march anonymous whistle blowers including former staff have come forward making claims that boys and girls were segregated in classrooms and assemblies and sex education was banned it was also alleged that non muslim staff had been bullied and in one case it was alleged that the teachings of a firebrand al qaeda linked muslim preacher praised to pupils investigation education secretary michael gove left and birmingham city council leader sir albert bore right birmingham city council today announced the six month appointment of mr kershaw managing director of northern education to handle the investigation and the council said it was also setting up a review group made up of mps councillors police and faith groups the council s leader sir albert bore said the investigation was slowed by the two tier school system which meant that academies which are at the centre of the allegations were answerable not to the local authority but to the dfe calling the situation frustrating in the extreme and sir albert suggested that the alleged muslim extremist plot may extend beyond birmingham saying that his authority had spoken to councils in both manchester and bradford he said there are certainly issues in bradford which have similarities with the issues being spoken about in birmingham fresh claims have emerged in manchester and at bradford s laisterdyke business and enterprise college and carlton bolling college an ofsted spokesman said it had not begun inspections there but did not rule it out sir albert also said that west midlands police which has reopened a fraud inquiry into one of the schools caught up in the allegations was still looking into the authorship of the trojan horse document the authenticity of which is still unclear lindsey clark the headteacher of park view said she would act against anyone plotting against the school one of the schools being investigated over extremist infiltration cancelled its annual visit from father christmas last year teacher vicky hubble who organised the event at the secular ladypool primary school was allegedly told to cancel it by the new muslim headmaster huda aslam he is said to have told her there would be no presents and no mention of jesus being the son of god according to a fellow teacher mr aslam wanted to reduce festivities to little more than sing alongs to songs such as jingle bells but was forced to reinstate the christmas assembly by birmingham council however santa remained banned but a dfe official said yesterday extreme religious conservatism often acts as an entry to later problems a child who is brought up age eight nine ten believing that you should segregate the sexes and hand out islamic textbooks is more likely to be radicalised in later life david cameron has promised swift action to ensure schools are not used to spread terrorist ideology birmingham city council froze appointments of any new school governors last week but mps said change should have come sooner liam byrne labour mp for birmingham hodge hill which covers several of the schools said the probe was moving at glacial speed birmingham mp khalid mahmood said that the council has known of the claims for eight years at least but had failed to act for fear of appearing anti muslim \\\\Summary:\\nplot against birmingham schools was uncovered in document last month
